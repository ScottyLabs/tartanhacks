                    A primary goal of TartanHacks is to introduce people from
                    the CMU community to hacking and hacking culture,
                    regardless of background and experience level.  To
                    that end, we open registration for freshmen and female
                    hackers one hour early.
                </p>

                    We invite the entire CMU community to register for
                    TartanHacks.  There are 250 available spots, and everyone
                    else will be placed on our waitlist.
                    If you're on the waitlist, just come to our check-in on
                    February 5th and you may be accepted then.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <br/>
        <b>Can I register with a team?</b>
        <br/>
        Currently we're having everyone sign up as an individual for the event, and we'll have you specify your team later on. Don't worry, if you already have a team chosen, you'll still be able to work with them.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>How many people can we have per team?</b>
        <br/>
        Up to 4 people are allowed.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>If I don't have a team before the event, can I still participate?</b>
        <br/>
        Absolutely! We've set aside some time at the beginning of event for helping hackers create teams.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>I got in, but a few of my team members were put on the waitlist. Will they be able to participate?</b>
        <br/>
        Because of the size of the event and the individual registration, we're unable to guarantee that the whole team will be accepted. However, if they're on the waitlist, there's still hope! See the next question.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Is there a way to get off of the waitlist?</b>
        <br/>
        Definitely show up on the 5th at Porter 100 anyways - we start letting in hackers first come first serve off of the waitlist at 5:30. We've historically had many open slots and it's likely that you'll get into the event.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>How much does it cost to participate in TartanHacks?</b>
        <br/>
        Nothing. TartanHacks is free for all current CMU students.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>I'm not a CS major, can I still join?</b>
        <br/>
        Yes! All majors and programs, even if they aren't technical, can participate in TartanHacks. We're running a series of talks called TartanHacks Crash Course the weekends leading up to TartanHacks to help you brush up your skills.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Who runs TartanHacks?</b>
        <br/>
        TartanHacks is run by ScottyLabs, a student organization at Carnegie Mellon that develops apps for CMU and runs educational events, like TartanHacks. ScottyLabs isn't affiliated with any academic department, and all of our funding comes from our sponsor companies.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>What if I need help during the hackathon?</b>
        <br/>
        We'll have a team of mentors on hand for the entire hackathon who have skills in almost every type of project you could work on. They'll be able to answer your questions, help you debug, and help you along with anything you might not be confident with. They can't make your project for you, but they are always there to help!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>What can I prepare before the hackathon?</b>
        <br/>
        You can come up with an idea and know what you'd like to use before the event. In fact, it might be better to do that; brainstorming can take up lots of valuable time at the beginning of the hackathon. You CANNOT, however, do any work on your hack. Any hack that is suspiciously more advanced or complex than ~24 hours of work by four competent team members will be subject to investigation and possible disqualification.
