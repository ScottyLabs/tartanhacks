- title: How to Get Updates
  text: >
      Mark yourself as going to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1343330915710050/">Facebook event</a>. When we have urgent updates, we will post in the Facebook event and you will be notified of the changes.</p><p>
      We will also be sending out emails to the TartanHacks mailing list, but we are guessing people check notifications from their phone more often than checking their email.
- title: How to Request a Mentor
  text: >

      If you need help getting through a bug, send us a Slack message in the
      mentor channel. To do this, first make sure you have joined the
      TartanHacks 2019 Slack workspace and the mentor channel within the
      workspace. Then, send us a message including your location and what
      technologies your bug involves so that we can pair you with a suitable
      mentor. We will try to send a mentor your way as soon as possible!
- title: How to Submit
  text: >

      We will be doing submissions via <a
      href="https://devpost.com">DevPost</a>. When we get closer to the
      deadline (4:30PM on Saturday), we will be accepting submissions on our <a
      href="https://tartanhacks2019.devpost.com/">DevPost Hackathon
      Page</a>.</p><p>

      DevPost also requires an account, so make sure you create one before
      submission time! Only one person from your team needs an account in order
      to submit. If more than one person has an account, you should only submit
      once, then connect the other team member accounts to the one submission.
