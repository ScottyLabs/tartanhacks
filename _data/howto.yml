- title: How to Get Updates
  text: >
      Mark yourself as going to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1343330915710050/">Facebook event</a>. When we have urgent updates, we will post in the Facebook event and you will be notified of the changes.</p><p>
      We will also be sending out emails to the TartanHacks mailing list, but we are guessing people check notifications from their phone more often than checking their email.
- title: How to Request a Mentor
  text: >

      If you need help getting through a bug, you can fill out a form with your
      location and some information about what you need help with, and we will
      send a mentor your way. <a
      href="https://tartanhacks.com/help">tartanhacks.com/help</a> will
      redirect you to the correct form. Once you've filled out the form, you
      can comment on the issue to update mentors with more information. If you
      want to get back to your submission afterwards, you can look at the <a
      href="https://github.com/scottylabs/hackerhelp/issues">help list</a></p><p>

      Since this form is submitted via GitHub, someone on your team will need
      to have a GitHub account to submit an issue. It is free to <a
      href="https://github.com/join">create an account</a>. If you don't have
      a GitHub account, you will probably want one in the near future, so we
      hope this isn't prohibitive. If you are strongly against signing up, you
      can contact tartanhacks@<span class="displaynone">X</span>scottylabs.org
      for help, but we may not be able to resopnd as quickly.
- title: How to Submit
  text: >

      We will be doing submissions via <a
      href="https://devpost.com">DevPost</a>. When we get closer to the
      deadline (4:30PM on Saturday), we will be accepting submissions on our <a
      href="https://tartanhacks2017.devpost.com/">DevPost Hackathon
      Page</a>.</p><p>

      DevPost also requires an account, so make sure you create one before
      submission time! If you already have a GitHub account from sending mentor
      requests, you can use that to sign in to DevPost. Only one person from
      your team needs an account in order to submit. If more than one person
      has an account, you should only submit once, then connect the other team
      member accounts to the one submission.
