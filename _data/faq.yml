    Yes! All undergradauate majors and programs, even if they aren't technical, are welcome at
    TartanHacks. We have slides from a series of <a href="https://scottylabs.org/wdw/" style="text-decoration:none">web 
    development workshops</a> online that you can use to brush up your skills! We'll also have
    some workshops during the event so you can get started with new frameworks.

- question: Is TartanHacks open to first-year students?
  answer: >
    Yes! We welcome students of all skill levels to participate. First-year students and
    first-time hackers have always been part of TartanHacks; we would
    love to see you at the event! Some prizes will also be specific for beginner hackers.

- question: I'm a graduate student. Can I still participate?
  answer: >
    Unfortunately, graduate students cannot participate. TartanHacks is
    currently limited to undergraduate students only.

- question: Are non-CMU students allowed to attend?
  answer: >
    Yes! However, we are unable to offer travel reimbusement,
    so you will have to provide for your own transportation. Anyone with an educational
    email address can sign up on the registration system.

- question: Can I register with a team?
  answer: >
    You have to sign up as an individual for the event, and we'll have you specify 
    your team later on. Don't worry, if you already have a team chosen you'll still be 
    able to work with them during event.

- question: If I don't have a team before the event, can I still participate?
  answer: >
    Absolutely! We'll have a team mixer after the opening ceremony to help you meet new hackers.

- question: How many people can we have per team?
  answer: >
    Up to 4 people are allowed.

- question: I'm confused about my registration status. How does the registration process work?
  answer: >
    There are 3 states you can be in.<br>
    1. <b>Submitted</b>. You have submitted your application, but we
    haven't accepted you yet. Don't worry though; we are doing acceptances in
    waves, i.e. one wave each day, up until early Friday morning.<br>
    2. <b>Admitted</b>. We have accepted your TartanHacks application!
    The final step is to click 'Confirm Your Spot' and fill out the form.<br>
    3. <b>Confirmed</b>. All you need to do is show up on Friday at 4PM
    for check in! Your spot in TartanHacks is confirmed.

- question: Does everyone who registers get to participate at TartanHacks?
  answer: >
    We expect that everyone who registers can get in. However, sometimes more
    hackers sign up than we can admit. Once registration closes, hackers
    are accepted on a rolling basis. You will be notified via email about your
    registration status.

- question: I got in, but a few of my team members were put on the waitlist. Will they be able to participate?
  answer: >
    Hackers are accepted individually, so we are unable to guarantee that all
    members of your team will get in. However, if they're on the waitlist,
    there's still hope! See the next question.

- question: Is there a way to get off of the waitlist?
  answer: >
    We will be letting hackers off the waitlist on a first-come, first-serve
    basis on the day of the event. Historically, many people have gotten off
    the waitlist.

- question: Are we limited to software projects or are hardware hacks allowed?
  answer: >
    Hardware hacks are certainly allowed! We don't restrict projects to
    software, though you will need to bring your own hardware/materials.

- question: What if I need help during the hackathon?
  answer: >
    We will have a team of student and corporate mentors on hand who are experts 
    in many common technologies. They'll be able to answer your questions, help
    you debug, and get you set up with new frameworks. They can't
    make your project for you, but they are always there to help!

- question: Who runs TartanHacks?
  answer: >
    TartanHacks is run by <a href="https://scottylabs.org/" style="text-decoration:none">ScottyLabs</a>, 
    a student organization at Carnegie Mellon University that develops apps 
    for CMU and runs educational events, like TartanHacks. ScottyLabs isn't
