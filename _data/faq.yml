- question: Are non-CMU students allowed to attend?
  answer: >
    Yes! However, we are unable to offer a transportation stipend,
    so you will have to provide for your own transportation.

- question: How can I prepare before the hackathon?
  answer: >
    You can come to <a href="https://scottylabs.org/crashcourse">Crash Course</a>
    to learn about topics ranging from web development to data science and more!
    You can also come up with an idea and know what you'd like to use before the
    event. However, you are not allowed to pre-write any code for your hack.
    Furthermore, any libraries you use must be open-source.

- question: I'm not a CS major, can I still join?
  answer: >
    Yes! All majors and programs, even if they aren't technical, are welcome at
    TartanHacks. We're running a series of talks called <a
    href="https://scottylabs.org/crashcourse">Crash Course</a> the weekends leading up to TartanHacks
    to help you brush up your skills.

- question: Is TartanHacks open to first-years?
  answer: >
    Yes! We welcome students of all skill levels to participate.  Freshmen and
    other first-time hackers have always been part of TartanHacks; we would
    love to see you at the event!

- question: Can I register with a team?
  answer: >
    Currently we're having everyone sign up as an individual for the
    event, and we'll have you specify your team later on.  Don't worry,
    if you already have a team chosen, you'll still be able to work with
    them.

- question: How many people can we have per team?
  answer: >
    Up to 4 people are allowed.

- question: If I don't have a team before the event, can I still participate?
  answer: >
    Absolutely! We've set aside some time at the beginning of event for helping hackers create teams.

- question: I'm confused about my registration status. How does the registration process work?
  answer: >
    There are 3 states you can be in.<br>
    1. <b>Submitted</b>. In this case, you have submitted your application, but we
    haven't accepted you yet. Don't worry though; we are doing acceptances in
    waves, i.e. one wave each day, up until early Friday morning.<br>
    2. <b>Admitted</b>. In this case, we have accepted your TartanHacks application!
    The final step is to click 'Confirm Your Spot' and fill out the form.<br>
    3. <b>Confirmed</b>. In this case, all you need to do is show up on Friday at 4PM
    for check in! Your spot in TartanHacks is confirmed.

- question: Does everyone who registers get to participate at TartanHacks?
  answer: >
    We expect that everyone who registers can get in. However, sometimes more
    hackers sign up than we can admit. Once registration closes, hackers
    are accepted based on a combination of registration order and a random
    process. Those who are accepted after registration will be notified via
    email. All other registrants will receive an email with information about
    our waiting list, allowing them to participate if accepted hackers do not
    show up.

- question: I got in, but a few of my team members were put on the waitlist. Will they be able to participate?
  answer: >
    Hackers are accepted individually, so we are unable to guarantee that all
    members of your team will get in. However, if they're on the waitlist,
    there's still hope! See the next question.

- question: Is there a way to get off of the waitlist?
  answer: >
    We will be letting hackers off the waitlist on a first-come, first-served
    basis on the day of the event.  Historically, many people have gotten off
    the waitlist.

- question: How much does it cost to participate in TartanHacks?
  answer: >
    Nothing. TartanHacks is free for all undergraduate students!

- question: I'm a graduate student, can I still participate?
  answer: >
    Unfortunately, graduate students cannot participate. TartanHacks is
    currently limited to undergraduate students only.

- question: Are we limited to software projects or are hardware hacks allowed?
  answer: >
    Hardware hacks are certainly allowed! We don't restrict projects to
    software, though you will need to bring your own hardware/materials.

- question: Who runs TartanHacks?
  answer: >
    TartanHacks is run by ScottyLabs, a student organization at Carnegie
    Mellon that develops apps for CMU and runs educational events, like
    TartanHacks. ScottyLabs isn't affiliated with any academic department,
    and all of our funding comes from our sponsor companies.

- question: What if I need help during the hackathon?
  answer: >
    We will have a team of mentors on hand who are experts in many common
    technologies. They'll be able to answer your questions, help you debug, and
    help you along with anything you might not be confident with. They can't
    make your project for you, but they are always there to help!
