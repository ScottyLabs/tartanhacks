- question: Can I register with a team?
  answer: >
    Currently we're having everyone sign up as an individual for the
    event, and we'll have you specify your team later on.  Don't worry,
    if you already have a team chosen, you'll still be able to work with
    them.

- question: How many people can we have per team?
  answer: >
    Up to 4 people are allowed.

- question: If I don't have a team before the event, can I still participate?
  answer: >
    Absolutely! We've set aside some time at the beginning of event for helping hackers create teams.

- question: I got in, but a few of my team members were put on the waitlist. Will they be able to participate?
  answer: >
    Hackers are accepted individually, so we are unable to guarantee that
    all members of your team will get in. However, if they're on the waitlist, there's still hope! See the next question.

- question: Is there a way to get off of the waitlist?
  answer: >
    We will be letting hackers off the waitlist on a first-come,
    first-served basis.  Historically, many people have gotten off the
    waitlist.

- question: How much does it cost to participate in TartanHacks?
  answer: >
    Nothing. TartanHacks is free for all current CMU students.

- question: I'm not a CS major, can I still join?
  answer: >
    Yes! All majors and programs, even if they aren't technical, can
    participate in TartanHacks. We're running a series of talks called
    <a href="/crashcourse">Crash Course</a> the weekends leading up to
    TartanHacks to help you brush up your skills.

- question: Are we limited to software projects or are hardware hacks allowed?
  answer: >
    Hardware hacks are certainly allowed! We don't restrict projects to
    software, though you will need to bring your own hardware/materials.

- question: Who runs TartanHacks?
  answer: >
    TartanHacks is run by ScottyLabs, a student organization at Carnegie
    Mellon that develops apps for CMU and runs educational events, like
    TartanHacks. ScottyLabs isn't affiliated with any academic department,
    and all of our funding comes from our sponsor companies.

- question: What if I need help during the hackathon?
  answer: >
    We'll have a team of mentors on hand who are experts in many common
    technologies. They'll be able to answer your questions, help you debug,
    and help you along with anything you might not be confident with. They
    can't make your project for you, but they are always there to help!

- question: What can I prepare before the hackathon?
  answer: >
    You can come up with an idea and know what you'd like to use before the
    event. However, you are not allowed to pre-write any code for your hack.
    Furthermore, any libraries you use must be open-source.
