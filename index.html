            <h1>Technical Difficulties</h1>
            <p>We're really sorry guys. Right around 5 p.m., we made an error with our registration website. Because we want to make up for this and be as fair as we possibly can, this is what we're going to do:
            <p>If you were able to register on Monday, and you got a confirmation email, then you are all set, your registration is confirmed. We'll be sending out confirmation emails sometime late Monday night.</p>
            <p>Since there was already about 45 minutes of registration time where people were able to priority register, there will be no further priority registration on Tuesday.</p>
            <p>Registration will open at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, open to all participants.</p>
            <p>Once again, we're really sorry about this, but we're looking forward to an awesome hackathon!</p>

            <h1>FAQ</h1>

            <p class="question">How many people are you accepting initially?</p>
            <p class="answer">We'll accept 350 hackers before we have to start waitlisting.</p>
            <hr>

            <p class="question">What's the maximum team size?</p>
            <p class="answer">You can have at most 4 people on one team.</p>
            <hr>

            <p class="question">Do I need to specify my team at the time of registration?</p>
            <p class="answer">Nope! We'll be doing team registration later. The biggest thing is just to sign up, so not having a team right now shouldn't be a deterrent!</p>
            <hr>

            <p class="question">What's the registration process like?</p>
            <p class="answer">We give priority registration to first-years and female hackers. They'll be able to register an hour early at 5 p.m. After registration opens, about 350 spots will be given away first come, first serve. If you don't get a spot, you can still get on the waitlist, where there's a good chance you'll still be able to participate. More specific waitlist instructions will be sent out before the hackathon.</p>
            <hr>

            <p class="question">How much does it cost to participate in TartanHacks?</p>

            <hr>

            <p class="question">I'm not a CS major; can I still join?</p>
            <p class="answer">Yes! All majors and programs, even if they aren't technical, can participate in TartanHacks. Before you come, it's probably a good idea to brush up on your programming skills: check out the <a href="http://scottylabs.org/webdevweeks/">Web Dev Weeks website</a> to find some awesome tutorials on web development.</p>
            <hr>

            <p class="question">I want to do a hardware hack. Is this okay?</p>
            <p class="answer">Yes! Hardware hacks are welcome, but we don't provide equipment. If you need special accommodations for your demo, let an organizer know and we'll do our best to help you out.</p>
            <hr>

            <p class="question">Who runs TartanHacks?</p>
            <p class="answer">TartanHacks is run by <a href="http://scottylabs.org">ScottyLabs</a>, a student organization at Carnegie Mellon that develops apps for CMU and runs educational events, like TartanHacks. ScottyLabs isn't affiliated with any academic department, and all of our funding comes from our sponsor companies.</p>
            <hr>

            <p class="question">What kind of prizes can I win?</p>
            <p class="answer">There will be a grand prize for our hackathon, which will be awarded by a panel of judges from Carnegie Mellon. Our sponsors will also award prizes in a variety of categories, for creativity, technical prowess, and novelty.</p>
            <hr>

            <p class="question">How can I get in touch with the organizers?</p>

            <p class="answer">Send an email to <a href="mailto:info@scottylabs.org">info@scottylabs.org</a>!</p>
