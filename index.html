            <p class="question">Q: How many people are you accepting initially?</p>
            <p class="answer">A: 350</p>
            <hr>

            <p class="question">Q: What's the registration process like?</p>
            <p class="answer">A: We give priority registration to first-years and female hackers. They'll be able to register an hour early at 5pm. After registration opens, about 350 spots will be given away first come, first serve. If you don't get a spot, you can still get on the waitlist, where there's a good chance you'll still be able to participate. More specific waitlist instructions will be sent out before the hackathon.</p>
