# Overview

## Announcements

There are three pretty straightforward endpoints for handling announcements.
`POST` and `DELETE` require superuser privileges (what this means will be
better defined once auth is all worked out).

### GET `/announcements`
### POST `/announcements`
### DELETE `/announcements/:id`
